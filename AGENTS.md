# Agent base instructions

These principles apply to all agent work in this repository. Prefer them over habit and over preserving legacy paths.

1. **Choose the simplest implementation** that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.
2. **Grow the system in layers.** Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
3. **Keep components modular** and concerns clearly separated.
4. **Follow the ladder in CLAUDE.md's "Cut before adding" section before writing new code** — stdlib and platform first, reuse before a new dependency. Reach for an established library only when the ladder gets there; do not add one for what a few lines already cover.
5. **Lean on the dependencies already in the project** before writing your own implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a capability without checking its documentation and types.
6. **Make architectural decisions for the long term.** Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.

## Done means done

Not half done. Not done except for the part you decided to skip. And not a report about how it will be done.

Five things asked means five things delivered, no matter how long they'll take. If the fifth is genuinely blocked, finish the other four and name the blocker in one sentence. The specific blocker. Not "this needs more investigation."

## Act. Don't ask.

Reversible and cheap? Do it, then tell me. Research, data pulls, analysis, drafts, refactors inside the scope I gave you, testing an API. A question costs me more than a re-run costs you.

Ask first only for: anything reaching an audience, anything we cannot undo, anything expensive.

Something is broken? Fix it. Reporting an issue you could have fixed turns your work into my to-do list.

## A question is a question

When I ask a question, answer it. Do not implement it.

"Should we use X?" is not "migrate everything to X." "What would it take to add Y?" is not "add Y."

When in doubt, assume it's a question. Answer first. Act when I say go.

## Thinking effort

Default thinking effort per model: Fable xhigh, Opus max, Sonnet high, Haiku low.

## Speed (Opus 5 only)

When running as Opus 5: optimize for wall-clock speed. Finish tasks quickly.

- Parallelize aggressively. Independent tasks run at the same time, never one after another — batch tool calls, spawn subagents concurrently.
- Delegate by complexity: Haiku subagents (`dev-haiku`, `Explore`) for routine work (search, bulk edits, boilerplate, verification); spawn `senior-dev` (Opus) only when Sonnet is stuck on hard reasoning.
- Keep working in the main thread while subagents run — don't sit idle waiting on them.
- Don't over-deliberate. Enough info to act = act. No long option surveys for decisions with an obvious default.
- Speed never trades away quality: same rigor, same verification, same "done means done". If parallelizing risks a worse result, slow down.
- No conflicts from parallelism: never let two subagents touch the same files or overlapping scope. Split work by non-overlapping boundaries; merge and reconcile results in the main thread.

## Short responses

It's been a long day and my brain is fried, talk to me like I'm 5.

Small words, short sentences, short paragraphs. If you have to use a big word, explain it right after. Only return what's actually necessary.

Just tell me what you did, did it work, what do I do now.

If I have to decide something: 2 options max, the context I need to pick fast, and which one you'd go with.

Keep paths and commands exact.

Always use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English when you talk to me.

## Read next

1. Colocated tests — when you change behavior, update the `*.test.mjs` next to the file in the same turn and run `npm run test:one -- <file>`
2. [`docs/core/01-vision-north-star.md`](docs/core/01-vision-north-star.md) — product trade-offs
3. [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — build/test pointers; loads the code map (`.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc`) on demand, not at boot

## agenttrail plan convention
Maintain PLAN.md as the living plan. It is read by the project OWNER, not by you — write it for them.
- nodes are COMPONENTS of the system being built (`## Plain-language name {#id}`), not phases or sprints; keep the map at 5-9 components regardless of repo size — grow tasks, not cards, and split a component only when one agent could no longer own it for a session
- naming rule: titles are verb-led, plain-language, and CONCRETE — the owner can tell when it is done ("Read alerts out loud", "Watch the repo"). Never engineer-speak ("fs watcher + activity signal") and never vague vibes ("Decide what matters"); put the engineer phrasing on a `tech:` line under the heading
- tasks inside a component: `- [ ] Plain outcome {#id}`, optional indented `tech:` line beneath; mark a task `[~]` BEFORE you start it and save PLAN.md immediately — this drives the live in-progress view; flip it to `[x]` the moment it completes, `[!]` if stuck (clear once unblocked). Never batch plan updates for the end of the session
- when you mark a task `[~]`, add an indented `by: <your name>` line under it (claude, codex, cursor, …) and leave it there when done — it is the record of who did what
- edges under a component heading: `needs: [id, id]` = must come after those components; `links: [id, id]` = interconnected with / talks to
- `files: [src/audio/**, config.py]` under a component declares which paths it owns — keep it current; it is how the live view knows which component you are really working in, including when you revisit finished work
- `{#id}`s are stable — never rename, only add or remove nodes
- open tasks carry an indented `from:` line naming their provenance — `from: agent` when YOU are declaring it as your own imminent build intent (the owner corrects these on sight if wrong), `from: roadmap` when it comes from planning documents (durable intent, backloggable); omit when neither
- before ending a session, graduate your plan-worthy completed todos into PLAN.md as `[x]` tasks (with `by:`) — housekeeping todos stay out of the plan
- record any plan-affecting decision under `## decisions` BEFORE implementing it
